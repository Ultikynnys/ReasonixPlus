<h3 align="center">A multi-provider coding agent for Windows, engineered around prefix-cache stability.</h3>
<p align="center">Token costs stay low across long sessions, so it is a tool you can leave running.</p>

> [!NOTE]
> **This is a standalone project.** It is based on v0.53 of
> [DeepSeek Reasonix](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix), but it has diverged enough to
> stand on its own: it is no longer a DeepSeek-native agent but a **multi-provider** one (DeepSeek,
> OpenAI, Ollama, Z.AI, and Gemini/Antigravity), the Ink TUI and the interactive CLI chat modes are
> gone, the only product surface is the Tauri 2 Windows app backed by a headless JSON-RPC daemon, and
> the cache-first loop from the v0.53 line was ported forward. It is maintained here only and is
> never intended to be pushed or merged back upstream; treat the two codebases as unrelated. The
> concrete differences are listed in [Divergence from upstream](#divergence-from-upstream).

> [!TIP]
> **Cache stability is not a feature you turn on; it is an invariant the loop is designed around.**
> DeepSeek bills cached input at a small fraction of the miss rate, and the cache only hits when the
> exact byte prefix of the previous request is preserved. Every layer of the loop is tuned to keep
> that prefix byte-stable. DeepSeek remains the default backend; OpenAI, Ollama, Z.AI, and Gemini
> are supported as options (see [Backends and models](#backends-and-models)).

## Install

### Windows desktop app (recommended)

Download the latest Windows installer from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ultikynnys/ReasonixPlus/releases) and run
`Reasonix+_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe`. The installer is built and published by the
[release workflow](https://github.com/Ultikynnys/ReasonixPlus/actions/workflows/release.yml) on
every push to `main`, and the app auto-updates from the same releases. The app bundles its own Node
runtime, so no `npm install` or Node installation is needed.

- First run asks for a [DeepSeek API key](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys). The key is stored
  in the app's config; `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in `.env` is read as a fallback.
- SmartScreen may warn "Unknown publisher" while installers are unsigned: click **More info → Run
  anyway**. See [desktop/SIGNING.md](desktop/SIGNING.md) for the signing setup.
- **Windows only, by design.** Supported devices were deliberately simplified to a single
  platform: this project is maintained by one person who runs Reasonix+ on Windows only, and removing
  the macOS/Linux and CLI code (platform-specific Tauri configs, the bundled-Node platform
  branches, the Ink TUI, the interactive CLI commands) was the obvious way to keep the project
  lightweight and stable. There are no plans to bring other platforms back.
- User data lives in `~/.reasonix` (config, sessions, memory, skills).

## Backends and models

| Backend | Models | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DeepSeek (default) | `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` (experimental vision line) | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI-compatible | GPT-6 family (`gpt-6.1-sol`, `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-6-sol`, `gpt-6-luna`), GPT-5.6 family (`gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`) | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, optional `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for proxies / Azure-compatible gateways |
| Ollama | any local model via `ollama/<name>`; cloud Ollama is also supported | local daemon is keyless; cloud needs `OLLAMA_API_KEY` |
| Z.AI | GLM family, including `glm-5.3-flash` with vision and a 1M-token context window | `ZAI_API_KEY`; optional `ZAI_BASE_URL` |

- Models are picked in Settings → Models or from the composer. The Ollama catalog is fetched once at
  launch, cached for 60 s, and shared by every tab; refresh buttons force a refetch.
- `gpt-*` ids route to `https://api.openai.com/v1` automatically; `glm-*` ids route to
  `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4`; DeepSeek ids route to `https://api.deepseek.com`.
  Each endpoint has a corresponding optional base URL override.
- Reasoning effort (`low | medium | high | xhigh | max`) is set per model via the `/effort` command
  or Settings.
- Image attachments (paste or drop) are enabled for vision-capable models: the GPT-6 and GPT-5.6
  families, `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp`, `glm-5.3-flash`, and GLM `v` models. DeepSeek bills image tokens
  as input tokens.
- See [.env.example](.env.example) for the full list of supported environment variables.

## What makes Reasonix+ different

The loop is organized around three pillars, each one a response to DeepSeek's exact-prefix cache
billing:

1. **Cache-first loop.** Context is partitioned into an immutable prefix (system + tool specs,
   computed and pinned once per session), an append-only event log, and a volatile scratch region
   that never reaches the API. No rewrites, no injected timestamps: consecutive turns share a
   byte-stable prefix, so the cache hits turn after turn.
2. **Tool-call repair.** Malformed, truncated, or redundant tool calls are repaired (flatten,
   scavenge, storm, truncation) and re-dispatched instead of failing the turn.
3. **Cost control.** Flash-first defaults for the main loop and for every auxiliary call
   (subagents, summaries, compaction), turn-end auto-compaction of oversized tool results, a
   per-turn iteration cap with a grace window, an optional USD budget, and live cost/cache metering
   with off-peak/peak rate awareness (peak hours bill at 2x; off-peak applies all day on weekends,
   Beijing time).

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full writeup.

## Features

**Desktop app (Tauri 2, React)**

- Multi-tab sessions with persistent per-workspace state, a session list, and session titles.
- Composer with `@`-mentions for workspace files, image paste/drop for vision models, slash
  commands (`/new`, `/clear`, `/abort`, `/copy`, `/model`, `/search-engine`, `/skill`, `/theme`,
  `/currency`, `/lang`, `/plan <mode>`, `/effort <level>`), and queued sends.
- Edit modes `plan`, `review`, `auto`, `yolo` (Shift+Tab or `/model <mode>`): SEARCH/REPLACE edits
  are shown for approval in review mode; yolo mode skips approval and never pauses a productive turn
  at the iteration cap.
- Context panel listing files the agent read or edited; jobs panel for background processes.
- Status bar: live cache-hit %, context tokens, this-turn cost (USD/CNY), the current off-peak/peak
  rate period, account balance (DeepSeek) or weekly quota (GPT-5.6 Codex, Ollama plan), workspace,
  model + effort.
- Settings pages: general, models, MCP, skills, memory, rules, billing, shortcuts.
- Themes (dark/light plus accent styles), keyboard shortcuts.

**Agent runtime**

- MCP client with stdio, SSE, and Streamable HTTP transports, a server catalog, `.mcp.json` project
  config, and in-app server management.
- Skills: markdown playbooks in `<project>/.reasonix/skills/` and `~/.reasonix/skills/`, run inline
  or as isolated subagents; Claude-format skills under `.claude/skills/` load as-is.
- Memory: project (`REASONIX.md`), session, user, and runtime stores; user memory pins preferences
  into the prefix.
- Hooks: shell commands on lifecycle events, `PreToolUse` (gating), `PostToolUse`,
  `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`.
- Web search: `bing` by default (works from CN without a proxy), switchable in Settings to
  `bing-intl`, `searxng`, `metaso`, `baidu`, `tavily`, `perplexity`, `exa`, `brave`, Ollama
  cloud search, or Z.AI `search-prime`.
- Semantic index over the workspace via local Ollama embeddings (`nomic-embed-text` by default) or
  any OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint.
- Plan mode with structured, reviewable plans.
- Shell: allowlisted command execution with config-based permissions, command chains, background
  jobs with streaming output.
- Event log: every session is an append-only JSONL of typed kernel events, replayable through pure
  projections.

## Configuration

- User config: `~/.reasonix/config.json` (model, reasoning effort, web search engine, pricing
  overrides, rate limits, and more).
- Per-project: `<project>/.reasonix/settings.json` (hooks), `<project>/.reasonix/skills/`, and
  `<project>/REASONIX.md` (project memory).
- Environment variables: see [.env.example](.env.example). `REASONIX_LOG_LEVEL=INFO` controls
  console noise; durable diagnostics are always verbose and cannot be disabled.
- Diagnostics: each launch writes correlated JSONL files to `~/.reasonix/diagnostics/`. Backend
  files are capped at 10 MiB per segment and host files at 10 MiB per launch; the latest 10 are
  retained. Records include boot phases, model/tool/MCP timing, process health, host lifecycle,
  frontend performance entries, and errors. Content payloads and common credential forms are
  excluded or redacted. Sink initialization or write failure is reported explicitly.
- `REASONIX_TRANSCRIPT_DIR` relocates session transcripts; diagnostics remain separate.
- Pricing overrides: `pricingOverride` in `config.json` sets per-model USD rates when a model's
  published price is missing or wrong.
- Model provider mapping: a model id's provider is resolved from positive evidence — an explicit
  `models` entry, the signed-in Antigravity account's discovered ids, the built-in catalogs, or
  the `ollama/` addressing scheme — never from the id's name shape. Custom gateway ids declare
  their provider explicitly:

  ```json
  {
    "models": {
      "gpt-4o-custom": { "provider": "openai" },
      "my-private-gateway-id": { "provider": "gemini" }
    }
  }
  ```

  Valid providers: `deepseek`, `openai`, `ollama`, `gemini`, `zai`. Unmapped ids that match no
  catalog resolve to the default DeepSeek-compatible endpoint family.

## Development

Requires Node >= 22 and npm.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm install` | install dependencies (runs `scripts/postinstall.mjs`) |
| `npm run dev` | run the headless desktop backend (`tsx src/cli/index.ts desktop`) |
| `npm run build` | tsup bundle into `dist/` |
| `npm run build:desktop` | build the desktop UI (vite) |
| `npm run test` | vitest |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run format` | biome |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run typecheck:desktop` | desktop app typecheck |
| `npm run verify` | build + lint + typecheck + typecheck:desktop + tests (full local gate) |

- Desktop UI dev server: `npm --prefix desktop run dev`; the Tauri shell lives in
  `desktop/src-tauri/`.
- CI/release: `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs only when manually dispatched (Actions tab),
  never on push. A run verifies on Windows, bumps the patch version from the latest commit, tags
  `vX.Y.Z`, and publishes the NSIS installer to a GitHub Release (the app's updater reads
  `latest.json` from the latest release).

## Divergence from upstream

This project is standalone: it keeps the MIT license and the cache-first core from v0.53 of
DeepSeek Reasonix, but it is not a candidate for merging back into
[esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix](https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix), and no PRs or pushes
are aimed at it. Treat the two as unrelated. Everything else upstream was removed or changed:

- **Removed**: the Ink TUI and the interactive CLI commands (`code`, `replay`, `diff`); the
  embedded web dashboard server (config helpers remain, but nothing serves it); the QQ channel
  integration and its docs; upstream's community pages (Discord, sponsors, acknowledgments wall).
  All of it is scope: the project targets Windows only, so every cross-platform and CLI surface was
  cut to keep the build and runtime lightweight and stable.
- **Added / changed**: the Tauri 2 Windows app as the only product surface; Ollama support (local
  and cloud) with a shared, cached model catalog; the GPT-5.6 family and
  `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` in the official model list; image attachments; edit modes including
  `yolo`; the per-turn iteration cap with a grace window (yolo bypasses the pause); off-peak/peak
  rate display and the current pricing table; Codex and Ollama quota chips in the status bar.
- The backend entry (`src/cli/index.ts`) runs the headless JSON-RPC daemon over
  stdio, spawned by the Tauri shell.
